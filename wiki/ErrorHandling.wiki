#summary How to disable BREAK/SPACE and returning to BASIC on error.

= Introduction =

By default, 47loader:
  * detects BREAK/SPACE and aborts the load if it is being pressed;
  * returns if a load error is detected.

You can change both these behaviours.

= Ignoring BREAK/SPACE =

Define the symbol `LOADER_IGNORE_BREAK` in your code. That's all there is to it!
