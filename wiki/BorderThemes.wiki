#summary The border themes provided.

= Introduction =

By defining a label at assemble time, you can choose the border effect that the loader will use.  The effects, referred to as "themes", are encapsulated in chunks of code separate from the main logic.  New ones can easily be written.

The label to define to specify a theme is `LOADER_THEME_*`, where `*` is one of the theme names detailed below, e.g. `LOADER_THEME_RAINBOW`.
