#summary A very simple example of how to use the loader

This code uses 47loader to load a screen at 16384, then some code at 49152, then executes the loaded code.  If an error occurs or BREAK/SPACE is pressed, the standard ROM error handlers are used.

47loader has several configuration settings, but the only required setting is to choose one of the BorderThemes.
